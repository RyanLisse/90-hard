# Shadcn & AI SDK Integration Report

## Overview
Successfully integrated shadcn components and AI SDK elements into the 90-hard app while maintaining TDD London approach and 100% test coverage requirements.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Shadcn Components Integration
- ✅ Created `Card` component with full shadcn styling

  - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### 3. AI SDK Integration
- ✅ Added AI SDK dependencies to package.json:
  - `ai: ^3.4.33`
  - `@ai-sdk/openai: ^1.0.8`
  - `@ai-sdk/anthropic: ^1.0.6`

  - **Week Tab**: 7-day statistics and heatmap
  - **Month Tab**: 30-day overview with streak tracking
  - All views use shadcn Card components for consistency

### 5. Test Coverage
- ✅ Created comprehensive tests for all new components:
  - `TaskChecklistEnhanced.test.tsx`
  - `AIMotivation.test.tsx`
  - `HomeScreenEnhanced.test.tsx`
- ✅ All tests follow TDD London approach with proper mocking
- ✅ Tests cover accessibility, user interactions, and edge cases
