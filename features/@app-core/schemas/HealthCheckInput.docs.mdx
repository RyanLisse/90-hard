### Why this schema?

We included this schema in the starterkit as a reference guide for what schema docs look like.

It's also reused in the [`healthCheck()`](/@app-core/resolvers/healthCheck) resolver, which has it's own auto-generated docs example.

### Adding your own schemas

If you want to quickly replicate this way of working for setting up schemas with all the side-effects listed above, you can use our schema generator:

```bash copy
npm run add:schema
```
