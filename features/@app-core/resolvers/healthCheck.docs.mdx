### Why this resolver?

We included this resolver in the starterkit as a reference implementation for a simple API resolver.

While it can be used to verify that the application is running and responsive, its main goals for inclusion are to demonstrate:

- How to create a basic API resolver.
- What our way of working of creating resolvers gets you. (typesafety, async function, REST API, GraphQL API, docs)
- Automatic docgen for API resolvers. (this entire docs page)

### Adding your own resolvers

If you want to quickly replicate this way of working for setting up APIs with all the side-effects listed above, you can use our resolver generator:

```bash copy
npm run add:resolver
```
