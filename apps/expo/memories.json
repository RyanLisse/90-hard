Updated ProgressChart.tsx CompletionTrendChart: color=\"hsl(var(--chart-1))\" → color=\"var(--chart-1)\"\n2. Updated ProgressChart.tsx TaskSpecificChart: color=\"hsl(var(--chart-2))\" → color=\"var(--chart-2)\"  \n3. Updated test expectations: expect().toHaveStyle('color: hsl(var(--chart-1))') → expect().toHaveStyle('color: var(--chart-1)')\n4. Updated test expectations: expect().toHaveStyle('color: hsl(var(--chart-2))') → expect().toHaveStyle('color: var(--chart-2)')\n5. Added CSS variable definitions to test/setup.ts for test environment\n\nThe component now correctly uses CSS variables directly instead of wrapping them in invalid hsl() calls.",
