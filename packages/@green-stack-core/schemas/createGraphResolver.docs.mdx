We made it quite easy to enable GraphQL for your resolvers. The flow is quite similar to [adding API routes](/@green-stack-core/schemas/createNextRouteHandler).

*From a related route file*, add the following:

<TitleWrapper>
    ### Registering a GraphQL resolver
</TitleWrapper>

```ts {3, 11} filename="features / @app-core / routes / api / health / route.ts"
import { updatePost } from '@app/resolvers/updatePost.resolver'
import { createNextRouteHandler } from '@green-stack/schemas/createNextRouteHandler'
import { createGraphResolver } from '@green-stack/schemas/createGraphResolver'

/* --- Routes ------------ */

// exports of `GET` / `POST` / `PUT` / ...

/* --- GraphQL ----------- */

export const graphResolver = createGraphResolver(updatePost)
// Automatically extracts input (☝️) from graphql request context
```

After exporting `graphResolver` here, restart the dev server or run `npm run build:schema` manually.

This will:
- 1. pick up the `graphResolver` export
- 2. put it in our list of graphql compatible resolvers at `resolvers.generated.ts` in `@app/registries`
- 3. recreate `schema.graphql` from input & output schemas from registered resolvers

You can now check out your GraphQL API playground at [/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql)

## Related Automations

### `collect-resolvers` - script

```bash copy
npm run collect:resolvers
```

This script will:

- 1. Scan the `/routes/` folder in any of your non-app workspaces
- 2. Find all `route.ts` files that export a `createGraphResolver()` function
- 3. Re-export them in the `@app/registries/resolvers.generated.ts` file

The goal of this script is so you can define which resolvers should be registered for GraphQL on a feature by feature basis, instead of manually linking them somewhere centrally.

Overall, this will keep your features more modular and portable between GREEN stack / FullProduct.dev projects.

The [`collect-routes`](/@green-stack-core/scripts/collect-routes) script runs automatically on `npm run dev` and any production build commands.

### `build-schema` - script

```bash copy
npm run build:schema
```

This script will:

- 1. Import all the resolvers from your `@app/registries/resolvers.generated.ts` file
- 2. Read the input and output schemas from each resolver (the [Data Bridge](/@green-stack-core/schemas/createDataBridge) for the resolver logic)
- 3. Generate a new `schema.graphql` file in `@app/core/graphql/` folder
- 4. Bind the schema to the resolvers to create an executable schema and effortless GraphQL API

Meaning you won't need to manually write your own GraphQL schema, it will be generated automatically based on your resolvers.

The [`build-schema`](/@green-stack-core/scripts/build-schema) script runs automatically on `npm run dev` and any production build commands.

### [`add-resolver`](/@green-stack-core/generators/add-resolver) - generator

You don't need to manually create a new API route with `createGraphResolver()` every time you create a new resolver. You can use the [`add-resolver`](/@green-stack-core/generators/add-resolver) generator to create a new resolver and its API route at once:

```bash copy
npx turbo gen resolver
```
