# Universal `useRouter()` hook

```tsx
import { useRouter } from '@green-stack/navigation/useRouter'
```

You can use `router.push()` to navigate to a new page:

```tsx
const router = useRouter()

router.push('/examples/[slug]', '/examples/123')
```

> `.push()` will use a push operation on mobile if possible.

There are also other methods available on the `router` object:

- `router.navigate()` - Navigate to the provided href
- `router.replace()` - Navigate without appending to the history
- `router.back()` - Go back in the history
- `router.canGoBack()` - Check if there's history that supports invoking the `back()` function
- `router.setParams()` - Update the current route query params without navigating

## React Portability Patterns

Each environment has it's own optimized router. This is why there are also versions specifically for each of those environments:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="@green-stack-core" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="navigation" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="useRouter.expo.ts" />
                <FileTree.File name="useRouter.next.ts" />
                <FileTree.File name="useRouter.ts" />
                <FileTree.File name="useRouter.types.ts" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Where `useRouter.next.ts` covers the Next.js app router, and `useRouter.expo.ts` covers Expo Router. The main `useRouter.ts` retrieves whichever implementation was provided to the `<UniversalAppProviders>` component, which is further passed to `<CoreContext.Provider/>`:

```tsx /.expo/ /useExpoRouter/ filename="ExpoRootLayout.tsx" copy
import { useRouter as useExpoRouter } from '@green-stack/navigation/useRouter.expo'

// ... Later ...

const expoContextRouter = useExpoRouter()

<UniversalAppProviders
    contextRouter={expoContextRouter}
>
    ...
</UniversalAppProviders>
```

```tsx /.next/ /useNextRouter/ filename="NextRootLayout.tsx" copy
import { useRouter as useNextRouter } from '@green-stack/navigation/useRouter.next'

// ... Later ...

const nextContextRouter = useNextRouter()

<UniversalAppProviders
    contextRouter={nextContextRouter}
>
    ...
</UniversalAppProviders>
```

While the `useRouter.types.ts` file ensures both implementations are compatible with the same interface, allowing you to use the same `useRouter()` hook across both Expo and Next.js environments.

### Why this pattern?

The 'React Portability Patterns' used here are designed to ensure that you can easily reuse optimized versions of hooks across different flavours of writing React.

On the one hand, that means it's already set up to work with both Expo and Next.js in an optimal way.

But, you can actually add your own implementations for other environments, without having to refactor the code that uses the `useRouter` hook.

### Supporting more environments

Just add your own `useRouter.<environment>.ts` file that respects the shared types, and then pass it to the `<UniversalAppProviders>` component as `contextRouter`.
